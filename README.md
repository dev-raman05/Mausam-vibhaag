# Weather-project
In this project, I have build a website that will fetch weather information from an API with latitude, longitude query, if the user has given their location access. Else, the user can search for their city by its name.
Also, I have tried to add a background image based on the city of the user.
This website will give information like sunrise time, sunset time, humidity, visibility, pressure, wind speed, wind direction, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and weather description.
I fetched all this information from a weather API and then accessed them after converting them into a .json file.
Background image is also added using the API by using latitude, longitude, and city name as query.


If you want to visit the site, you can go to the link give below.
