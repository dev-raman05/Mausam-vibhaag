  "description": "In this project, I have build a website that will fetch weather information from an API with latitude,longitude query if the user give their location access else the user can search for their city by their city names. Also, I have tried to add a background image based on the city of the user. Also, This website will give information like sunrise time, sunset time, humidity,visibility, pressure, wind speed, wind degree, minimim temperature, maximum temperature, feels like and weather description. I fetched all these information from a weather API and then access them after converting them into .json file. Background image is also added using API by using latitude,longitude and city name as query.",
